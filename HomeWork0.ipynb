real life hollywood actress sandra dee.  i knew absolutely nothing about bobby darin before this film  but now i m a huge fan   said bosworth  who attended the premiere with british boyfriend orlando bloom.   there is darkness and tragedy in the story  and it was a dream for me to land this part.  actress sandra dee continues to live in los angeles as a virtual recluse  but has given her approval to the biopic.   she called me last week and said she loved it   said spacey  who was joined at the premiere by members of the boy band westlife. spacey  a double oscar-winner  has long been fascinated by the story of singer bobby darin. the voice behind mack the knife  dream lover and beyond the sea  fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s  but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life.  bobby darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known  and yet  because he died young  he s been kind of forgotten   said spacey at the premiere.  making this film was the most fun i ve ever had in my entire life.  the movie also stars british actors bob hoskins and brenda blethyn  as darin s mother.\",\n          \"brown  proud of economy record  gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labour s spring conference setting out the government s agenda for the next general election.  the chancellor said he was proud of his party s record on the economy  and would strive for continuing stability if elected. the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. later  prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail.  analysing mr brown s position before the speech  bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw  sharp dividing lines  with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. he would contrast labour s plan to invest \\u00a360bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by \\u00a335bn.  mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade   our correspondent said.  on friday night  mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget  expected in march. but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether  as the conservatives claim  he plans to raise tax after the election. the tories accuse labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997.  following the chancellor s keynote speech  the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday. mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election. capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. the prime minister s enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed  alan milburn  labour s election strategist told radio 4 s today programme on saturday. mr blair has  the same passion and the same commitments for the job  as when labour came to power in 1997  he said.  and he confirmed mr blair s insistence that no poll date had yet been set. he said:  i m the general election co-ordinator and i don t know  and tony has not made up his mind.  on friday  the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of england  during which he unveiled his party s six pre-election pledges. starting in london  he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labour s achievements on the economy  crime  education and public services. the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges - set to underpin labour s election campaign - were  worthless .\",\n          \"uk heading wrong way  says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Stemming tool from nltk\n","stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n","\n","# A mapping dictionary that help remove punctuations\n","remove_punctuation_map = dict((ord(char), None) for char in string.punctuation)"],"metadata":{"id":"NfBpo0HDGZVS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724988473425,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Aarya Choudhary","userId":"01782541135386868080"}}},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def get_tokens(text):\n","\n","  # turn document into lowercase\n","  lowers = text.lower()\n","\n","  # remove punctuations\n","  no_punctuation = lowers.translate(remove_punctuation_map)\n","\n","  # tokenize document\n","  tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(no_punctuation)\n","\n","  # remove stop words\n","  filtered = [w for w in tokens if not w in stopwords.words('english')]\n","\n","  # stemming process\n","  stemmed = []\n","  for item in filtered:\n","      stemmed.append(stemmer.stem(item))\n","\n","  # final unigrams\n","  return stemmed"],"metadata":{"id":"aWSjvtLsK-g5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724988473425,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Aarya Choudhary","userId":"01782541135386868080"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","\n","df['unigrams'] = df['Text'].apply(get_tokens)\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":278},"id":"LuN_SVq_PXqC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724988523856,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":50442,"user":{"displayName":"Aarya Choudhary","userId":"01782541135386868080"}},"outputId":"d0906ccb-0d1a-4269-a037-fadf7168a4cc"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   ArticleId                                               Text  Category  \\\n","0       1429  sfa awaits report over mikoliunas the scottish...     sport   \n","1       1896  parmalat to return to stockmarket parmalat  th...  business   \n","2       1633  edu blasts arsenal arsenal s brazilian midfiel...     sport   \n","3       2178  henman decides to quit davis cup tim henman ha...     sport   \n","4        194  french suitor holds lse meeting european stock...  business   \n","\n","                                            unigrams  \n","0  [sfa, await, report, mikoliuna, scottish, foot...  \n","1  [parmalat, return, stockmarket, parmalat, ital...  \n","2  [edu, blast, arsen, arsen, brazilian, midfield...  \n","3  [henman, decid, quit, davi, cup, tim, henman, ...  \n","4  [french, suitor, hold, lse, meet, european, st...

real life hollywood actress sandra dee.  i knew absolutely nothing about bobby darin before this film  but now i m a huge fan   said bosworth  who attended the premiere with british boyfriend orlando bloom.   there is darkness and tragedy in the story  and it was a dream for me to land this part.  actress sandra dee continues to live in los angeles as a virtual recluse  but has given her approval to the biopic.   she called me last week and said she loved it   said spacey  who was joined at the premiere by members of the boy band westlife. spacey  a double oscar-winner  has long been fascinated by the story of singer bobby darin. the voice behind mack the knife  dream lover and beyond the sea  fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s  but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life.  bobby darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known  and yet  because he died young  he s been kind of forgotten   said spacey at the premiere.  making this film was the most fun i ve ever had in my entire life.  the movie also stars british actors bob hoskins and brenda blethyn  as darin s mother.\",\n          \"brown  proud of economy record  gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labour s spring conference setting out the government s agenda for the next general election.  the chancellor said he was proud of his party s record on the economy  and would strive for continuing stability if elected. the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. later  prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail.  analysing mr brown s position before the speech  bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw  sharp dividing lines  with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. he would contrast labour s plan to invest \\u00a360bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by \\u00a335bn.  mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade   our correspondent said.  on friday night  mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget  expected in march. but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether  as the conservatives claim  he plans to raise tax after the election. the tories accuse labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997.  following the chancellor s keynote speech  the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday. mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election. capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. the prime minister s enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed  alan milburn  labour s election strategist told radio 4 s today programme on saturday. mr blair has  the same passion and the same commitments for the job  as when labour came to power in 1997  he said.  and he confirmed mr blair s insistence that no poll date had yet been set. he said:  i m the general election co-ordinator and i don t know  and tony has not made up his mind.  on friday  the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of england  during which he unveiled his party s six pre-election pledges. starting in london  he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labour s achievements on the economy  crime  education and public services. the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges - set to underpin labour s election campaign - were  worthless .\",\n          \"uk heading wrong way  says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"unigrams\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load allowed words from the provided 'dictionary.txt' file\n","with open('dictionary.txt','r') as file:\n","  allowed_words = set(line.strip().lower() for line in file)\n","\n","# Now we need to filter the unigrams as per the allowed words\n","def filter_unigrams(unigrams, allowed_words):\n","  return [word for word in unigrams if word in allowed_words]\n","\n","df['filtered_unigrams'] = df['unigrams'].apply(lambda unigram : filter_unigrams(unigram, allowed_words))\n","\n","df.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":293},"id":"JWI76hhdQGI-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724988523856,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Aarya Choudhary","userId":"01782541135386868080"}},"outputId":"f09dac69-f988-4924-901c-6e5a8494566e"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   ArticleId                                               Text  Category  \\\n","0       1429  sfa awaits report over mikoliunas the scottish...     sport   \n","1       1896  parmalat to return to stockmarket parmalat  th...  business   \n","2       1633  edu blasts arsenal arsenal s brazilian midfiel...     sport   \n","3       2178  henman decides to quit davis cup tim henman ha...     sport   \n","4        194  french suitor holds lse meeting european stock...  business   \n","\n","                                            unigrams  \\\n","0  [sfa, await, report, mikoliuna, scottish, foot...   \n","1  [parmalat, return, stockmarket, parmalat, ital...   \n","2  [edu, blast, arsen, arsen, brazilian, midfield...   \n","3  [henman, decid, quit, davi, cup, tim, henman, ...   \n","4  [french, suitor, hold, lse, meet, european, st...   \n","\n","                                   filtered_unigrams  \n","0  [report, scottish, footbal, associ, refere, re...  \n","1  [return, compani, went, account, hope, back, s...  \n","2  [arsen, arsen, hit, club, offer, new, contract...  \n","3  [decid, quit, davi, cup, great, britain, davi,...  \n","4  [french, hold, meet, european, stock, market, ...

bosworth attended the british premiere of new film  beyond the sea  in london s leicester square on thursday.  spacey  45  wrote  directed and starred in the film  inspired by the life of 1950s croooner bobby darin.  this is my tribute to someone i think was a remarkable talent   said spacey  who  as darin  sings all 18 songs on the film soundtrack. bosworth  21  plays darin s wife - real life hollywood actress sandra dee.  i knew absolutely nothing about bobby darin before this film  but now i m a huge fan   said bosworth  who attended the premiere with british boyfriend orlando bloom.   there is darkness and tragedy in the story  and it was a dream for me to land this part.  actress sandra dee continues to live in los angeles as a virtual recluse  but has given her approval to the biopic.   she called me last week and said she loved it   said spacey  who was joined at the premiere by members of the boy band westlife. spacey  a double oscar-winner  has long been fascinated by the story of singer bobby darin. the voice behind mack the knife  dream lover and beyond the sea  fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s  but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life.  bobby darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known  and yet  because he died young  he s been kind of forgotten   said spacey at the premiere.  making this film was the most fun i ve ever had in my entire life.  the movie also stars british actors bob hoskins and brenda blethyn  as darin s mother.\",\n          \"brown  proud of economy record  gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labour s spring conference setting out the government s agenda for the next general election.  the chancellor said he was proud of his party s record on the economy  and would strive for continuing stability if elected. the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. later  prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail.  analysing mr brown s position before the speech  bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw  sharp dividing lines  with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. he would contrast labour s plan to invest \\u00a360bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by \\u00a335bn.  mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade   our correspondent said.  on friday night  mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget  expected in march. but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether  as the conservatives claim  he plans to raise tax after the election. the tories accuse labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997.  following the chancellor s keynote speech  the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday. mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election. capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. the prime minister s enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed  alan milburn  labour s election strategist told radio 4 s today programme on saturday. mr blair has  the same passion and the same commitments for the job  as when labour came to power in 1997  he said.  and he confirmed mr blair s insistence that no poll date had yet been set. he said:  i m the general election co-ordinator and i don t know  and tony has not made up his mind.  on friday  the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of england  during which he unveiled his party s six pre-election pledges. starting in london  he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labour s achievements on the economy  crime  education and public services. the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges - set to underpin labour s election campaign - were  worthless .\",\n          \"uk heading wrong way  says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.\"\n
